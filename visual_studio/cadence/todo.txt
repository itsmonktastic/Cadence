== EDEN ==
- figure out what things require the cygwin POSIX compatibility layer. 
	are there any that can not be replicated without cygwin?
	looks like EDEN somehow relies on X libraries, possibly for making a GL context with Sasami? not sure how ttyeden and sasami play
	not sure whether cadence is using ttyeden or not, conflicting implications in makefiles
	
- figure out how hard it is to link against cygwin. :S
- figure out how to generate svnversion.h
